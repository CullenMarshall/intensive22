    <!-- either turn left (L) or right (R) 90 degrees, then walk forward the given number of blocks, 
        ending at a new intersection.
There's no time to follow such ridiculous instructions on foot, though, 
so you take a moment and work out the destination. 
Given that you can only walk on the street grid of the city,
 how far is the shortest path to the destination?
